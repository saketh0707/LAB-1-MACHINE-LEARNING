Student Performance Prediction
Overview
This repository contains code for building a predictive model to forecast student performance based on various factors such as disability status and Index of Multiple Deprivation (IMD) band. The model aims to classify whether a student will pass or fail a course.

Data
The dataset used for this analysis is stored in studentInfo.csv. It includes information on student demographics, disability status, IMD band, and final course results.

Setup
To run the code in this repository, you'll need to have R and the following R packages installed:

tidyverse
tidymodels
janitor
You can install these packages using the following commands in R:

R
Copy code
install.packages("tidyverse")
install.packages("tidymodels")
install.packages("janitor")
Usage
Clone this repository to your local machine.
Ensure you have the required packages installed.
Run the R script student_performance_prediction.R. This script performs data preprocessing, builds a logistic regression model, and evaluates its performance.
The results of the model evaluation will be displayed in the R console.
File Structure
studentInfo.csv: Input dataset containing student information.
student_performance_prediction.R: R script for data preprocessing, model building, and evaluation.
README.md: This README file providing an overview of the project.
